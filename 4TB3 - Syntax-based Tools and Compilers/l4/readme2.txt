In the instructions for lab 3, it mentioned that you are allowed to share a solution with only your partner. So, for that lab, I shared solutions with my partner because we split the work equally. I thought that this would be the case for lab 4 as well, so we split the work and I originally submitted my parters work for Q1, while I completed Q2. However, I did not realize until later that the lab 4 instructions say that you are not allowed to share solutions and that all submissions must be your own. So, after realizing this, I went back to Q1 and made my own solution, which is called Q1_justin.xsd. I would have deleted the version that I submitted to avenue that was done by my partner, but I don't think avenue lets you delete or override submissions. So, I am writing this message to the marker to make it clear that the original submission (Q1.xsd) is my partners work and the final submission (Q1_justin.xsd) is my work. Thank you.
