JTAC (Java to ARM compiler) is a tool that converts basic Java programs directly to ARM.
This makes it possible to run Java code without having to install JVM, and bypasses the bytecode generation phase.

Components:

1) Initialization file (JTAC.ini). Calls the scanner if a valid Java file is used as input.
2) Scanner (scanner.py). Scans Java file, creates a sentence, and passes it to parser.py.
3) Parser (parser.py) calls generator.py. If the sentence from scanner.py is accepted by the Java grammar, pass it to generator.py.
4) ARM code generator (generator.py). Generates ARM syntax based on Java sentence.

Instructions:

Run the scanner with ./JTAC.ini HelloWorld.java
Run the parser with "python rdparser.py"
