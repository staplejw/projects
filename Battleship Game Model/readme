Assignment 4 from 2ME3 only required me to write a specification for the battleship game, not implement it. So, as a fun side project, I implemented the specification that I wrote, which is a series of Python modules that model the game and store the game state. In the MVC model, it would just be considerd the model. That is to say, there is nothing to handle controlling the gameplay or displaying graphics.
